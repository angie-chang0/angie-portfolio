            and provides critical insights based on the latest SEC filings.

              InnisFree previously relied on an outsourced database for
               financial analysis and client advisory services. However,
                a shift to a new data provider necessitated the development
                 of an internal system capable of delivering more accurate,
                  timely, and comprehensive insights. This need paved the
                   way for the creation of ActiveIQ; a centralized, one-stop solution.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
              ActiveIQ was designed to track complex changes in share ownership and 
              the underlying factors driving these shifts. More importantly, it was 
              envisioned as a unified repository to consolidate the company's data.
               With legacy information previously scattered across multiple databases,
                the goal was to centralize all historical and future proprietary data
                 on ActiveIQ.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
              The new platform was intended to empower the investor relations team with
                  up-to-date data via a lightweight infrastructure, while simultaneously 
                  providing all other teams with an organized and easily accessible archive
                   of past information. My role in this project was to design and develop
                    the user interface for ActiveIQ. I focused on creating a clean, modern,
                     and intuitive interface that not only enhanced usability but also 
                     preserved elements familiar to the investor relations team, thereby
                      minimizing the transition period.

            To develop an intuitive and useful interface, I tasked 
            myself with understanding the daily responsibilities of 
            an IR analyst, and gaining familiarity with the financial 
            world. Under the guidance of my mentor and Program Director,
             Cody Panella, I learned the fundamental processes and key
              resources that IR analysts use, gained insights into how
               13F filings to the SEC are leveraged to forecast market
                trends and safeguard client stock, and was provided a
                 crash course on the stock market, proxy wars, and how
                  our company helps protect and serve clients.

              Through my research, I identified two key use cases for ActiveIQ:
               (1) providing fast, accessible information to IR analysts and (2)
                seamlessly transferring all existing data from legacy databases
                 to the new platform. To ensure a smooth transition, I designed 
                 an intuitive user experience that maintained familiarity while 
                 improving efficiency.

              I carefully selected a clean, modern color palette aligned with InnisFree
               M&A's branding to create visual consistency. Additionally, I optimized 
               navigation by replacing the outdated tree format with a card-based layout,
                allowing for quick selection and streamlined access to critical data. 
                My focus was on enhancing clarity and readability, ensuring that IR 
                analysts could interact with data in a format they were already accustomed 
                to while benefiting from a more structured and user-friendly interface.

            the essential layout of the previous database while refining the interface for improved usability. 
            For the homepage, I took a user-centered approach, considering the essential interactions and 
            dashboard elements needed to enhance workflow efficiency.

              the information pulled from the database. this was requested, as the pulled information

              a particular layout. Then, all future iterations were wireframed
              in figma for feedback from mentors, the development team, and 
              usability testing. I again used figma to create simple interactions,
              such as moving between pages, interacting with widgets, and scrolling through 
              lists. finally, I created a basic mockup in React which I hosted on github pages.
